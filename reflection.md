## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

**Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 

**Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

I think the geo plots were very interesting to see and how they can be interactive as well. Most maps I have made with seaborn or matplot I've struggled to make interactive. One thing that I am currious about is how flexible these maps can be,  as In I want to know If i could upload my own map of an esport game and see if I can get that to be interactive for my project. I've experimented in the past with matplot but was unsuccessful. Otherwise I think having the capability to make an interactive dashboard is really good and an essential skill to being a coder. One thing I wish I got to see with this assignment was being able to combine the two different dashboards we made but I do understand if that wasn't possible or if it just didnt seem right for this final assignment. Otherwise I do have experience with seaborn and matplot so I do have good experience with visualizations. I think the biggest gain for me in this unit was the interactive dashboard with the visuals.
